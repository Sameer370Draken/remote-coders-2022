        So basically their intention is to get some data from us. And use that for some purpose, it can be wrong or
        right depend on the attacker.
        <h4 style="color: wheat;margin-left: 50px; margin-right:3%;font-size: 20px; margin-left: 5%;">>>Why I need to

        <h6 style="color: white ;margin-left: 50px; margin-right:3%;font-size: 15px; margin-left: 5%;"> Many people know
            about these scams but they just fill details for just time pass or fun. So I need to write this blog to
            aware and tell the reality of these scams, these are so much dangerous scam. In our Hacking language this
            types of attack comes inside the Term SOCIAL ENGNEERING.
            <br> Social Engineering is type of technique or attack in which attacker tries to manage his/her victims
            mind to take over control of his/her mind. </h6>

            more.

        <h6 style="color: white;margin-left: 50px; margin-right:3%; font-size: 15px; margin-left: 5%;"> Every device has
            a
            unique digital
            address.
            They can use it for IP spoofing.
            <tag style="color: black;">IP Spoofing - </tag>in that attacker uses anyone IP in its own device
            like If i will assign your IP in my device now my device has your device address so if now i
            will visit any website it will get to know your ip hence it mean you visited that website but
            actually it was visited by me .It can be too much harmful if an
            attacker used your IP for doing some illegal stuffs.</h6>

        <h6 style="color: white;margin-left: 50px; margin-right:3%; font-size: 15px; margin-left: 5%;">
            It is a six byte hexadecimal address. IT is physical address of our network interface like in our
            phone there is a controller that controls all networking process, it has its a physical address
            like our network has ip address same as our network device has mac address. As hacker can use IP
            for spoofing so he can also use your MAC for MAC spoofing to do illegal kind of things using your
            device
            identity.</h6>

            So you will be thinking what he can do by using network details.
            Remember by this a kind of scam even many big people couldn't escape from it.
            Let as you are a business man. you used this scam website opened it and attacker got your ip, mac, location.

            network
            and as he has your IP and MAC so he can now do IP and MAC spoofing. You will be thinking what is the problem
            in
            this, attacker has spoofed his IP and MAC in that business man's network now all mails and data that was
            going
            to business man device will goto attacker device as he has spoofed business man's IP and MAC. and by this
            the
